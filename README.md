This project brings Schitt’s Creek characters to life through an emotionally adaptive chatbot, capable of detecting user emotions and responding in character-specific styles. Leveraging the power of PyTorch and NLP techniques, this chatbot combines BERT for nuanced emotion detection and GPT-3 for generating tailored responses. As users interact, the chatbot adapts its tone and dialogue, delivering responses true to beloved Schitt’s Creek personalities like Moira, David, and Alexis. With a robust pipeline of data pre-processing, sentiment analysis, and response generation, this project blends machine learning with a touch of humor and drama.
