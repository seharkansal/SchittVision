Alexis, if you're gonna be in this class, you are gonna have to learn to be less disruptive. Now let's see what was so important.

They paid for everything, it's like a form of child abuse. Don't quote me on this, but it seems like their intentions were good. I mean, they didn't buy all the good reviews your galleries got.

I mean, yeah, if someone hadn't snuffed out the last remaining embers of my self-confidence. Why don't you channel some of that charming self-pity into a business plan, okay? Because the lease is yours, David, if you still want it. If there's anyone in this town who might have the eye to create something truly beautiful, it's you, David. And me, but in this case, you. I will submit my application. There's cinnamon buns in the lobby! I know, where are these from? Yeah, I got those for the motel. They're supposed to be for the guests!

That really isn't necessary, Mrs. Schitt. \"Alexis is too pretty, and everyone's talking about the dress. So gorge.\" Okay, I love that you're so confident, Mhmm. It's just that we're going to have to focus a little less on ourselves, and a little more on the material. I stole this dress from Ashlee Simpson. Or like, she stole it from me, and then I stole it back. Do you wanna have lunch tomorrow? I just find it extremely violating. Because your parents threw money at you? They paid for everything, it's like a form of child abuse. Don't quote me on this, but it seems like their intentions were good. I mean, they didn't buy all the good reviews your galleries got. Yeah, I mean, they do give me a small weekly stipend for hanging out with you, so... David, there you are. I come bearing good news. And what's that, your friends at Christmas World are looking for a deeply embittered, mildly Hebraic-looking elf?! I thought you might like to know that council has agreed to accept your application. What about Christmas World? I had a very effective strategy to change everyone's minds, that I ultimately didn't get to use, because Christmas World pulled out. This is good news! I mean, yeah, if someone hadn't snuffed out the last remaining embers of my self-confidence. Why don't you channel some of that charming self-pity into a business plan, okay? Because the lease is yours, David, if you still want it. If there's anyone in this town who might have the eye to create something truly beautiful, it's you, David. And me, but in this case, you. I will submit my application. There's cinnamon buns in the lobby! I know, where are these from? Yeah, I got those for the motel. They're supposed to be for the guests! Okay, well, they were just sitting there. Oh, they weren't just sitting there, Alexis, they're the product of a lot of hard work!\"\n",
      "  Target: Moira: \"There are cinnamon buns in the lobby! Oh come on, Moira, Moira! These are for the continental breakfast we're offering at the motel! They're for the guests! It's a start, it's a start, it's a big step. What exactly goes into a \"continental breakfast?\" It's a breakfast, David, it's a light breakfast with pastries and coffee. What's continental about that? It's for business travelers, travelling the continent, eating breakfast, and... continental travelling. That doesn't sound even remotely correct. Well, it's European, Moira, so... Okay, come on, seriously! There's only one left?! I know, Stevie was eating the other one. Here, why don't you have this, and I'll take the big one. It's all right, I'll take care of it. Well, I guess it would be wrong to serve the guests day-olds. You know this bun added a star to our rating? How many did we have before?\"\n",
